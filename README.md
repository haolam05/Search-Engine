# Search-Engine

  - Develop a File System Crawler to read file content, parse it into words, and build a linked list of (word, position) information.
  - Implement an Indexer to convert these linked lists into an in-memory inverted index.
  - Create a Search Engine that utilizes the inverted index to build a query processor with a console-based interface.
  - Enhance system performance by migrating the in-memory inverted index to an on-disk index for improved scalability and efficiency.
  - Develop a multithreaded web server front-end for the query processor to enable web-based access to the search engine.
